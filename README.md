I recently created this to-do project.  The clone has been built using React JS, React-hooks, Styled-component, and Firebase (hosting & Deploying). I also plan to add further functionality such as user authorization, a dedicated backend to maintain the user database, and replicate it as close as possible to the original website.


### Steps Include : 

- Creating REACT App + Creating App on Firebase
- Adding firebase hosting to your app
- Deploying Your App to Firebase & Host it online
